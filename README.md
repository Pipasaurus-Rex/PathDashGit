# Pathology-Dashboard
Pathology Requesting Data Dashboard

This is the Django data visualisation dashboard I created for my Masters project for Manchester University.

This dashboard displays the pathology requesting patterns for A+E and GPs in my local NHS trust.
With this we aim to reduce un-necessary pathology requesting and improve requesting behaviours.

python==2.7.13

Django==1.10.4
